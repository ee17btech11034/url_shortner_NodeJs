🔗 URL Shortener: Evolution Edition (Node.js)
A step-by-step evolutionary project that transforms from a Basic Express API into a Full-Stack SSR Application with Authentication. This repo is designed as a learning resource where every commit represents a new architectural layer or feature.

🎯 The Philosophy
Most tutorials show you the "final" product. This repo shows you the process. By checking out different commits or tags, you can see how the code scales from a single file to a structured, secure, and production-ready application.

🛣️ The Learning Path
Level 0: The Core Logic – In-memory storage, basic routing, and redirection logic.

Level 1: Persistence – Integrating a database (MongoDB/SQL) to save links permanently.

Level 2: SSR with EJS – Moving from JSON responses to a visual UI using Embedded JavaScript templates.

Level 3: Analytics – Tracking click counts and timestamps for each URL.

Level 4: Security & Auth – Implementing User Sign-up/Login so users can manage their own links.

Level 5: Optimization – Adding URL validation, custom aliases, and rate limiting.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Runtime: Node.js

Framework: Express.js

Database: MongoDB (via Mongoose)

Templating: EJS

Auth: Passport.js / bcrypt
